## Data Strucure (DS)
This is a recap of Data Structure in Python3. The content is in the order of [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html). Implementing fundamental DS like: (linear) Stack, Queue, LinkedList, (Tree)Binary Tree, BST and Graph models etc.
